    <h2>Classic Spaghetti Bolognese</h2>
    <p>This classic spaghetti bolognese is a definition of a comfort and pleasing food. It features a rich,
        slow-simmered meat sauce (ragù) made with savory ground beef, a fragrant base of onion, carrort,
        and a robust tomato flavor. The sauce is hearty and thick, clinging to the long strands of spaghetti,
        and added with fresh basil and a generous dusting of Parmesan cheese, just like the image above.
