    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>Red bell peppers</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Curry powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the tomato base: Blend fresh tomatoes, red bell peppers, onions, garlic, and ginger until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the tomato sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the blended tomato mixture and cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate from the tomato base.</li>
        <li>Add spices: Stir in tomato paste, bay leaves, thyme, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Add rice and liquid: Rinse the parboiled rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat it with the tomato sauce. Pour in chicken broth or water, ensuring the rice is fully submerged. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid. Avoid lifting the lid too often to prevent steam from escaping.</li>
        <li>Fluff and serve: Once cooked, remove from heat and let it sit covered for an additional 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Garnish with fried plantains or your choice of protein.</li>
    </ol>
